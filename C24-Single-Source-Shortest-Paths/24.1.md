### Exercises 24.1-1
***
Run the Bellman-Ford algorithm on the directed graph of Figure 24.4, using vertex z as the source. In each pass, relax edges in the same order as in the figure, and show the d and π values after each pass. Now, change the weight of edge (z, x) to 4 and run the algorithm again, using s as the source.

### Exercises 24.1-3
***
Given a weighted, directed graph G = (V, E) with no negative-weight cycles, let m be the maximum over all pairs of vertices u, v ∈ V of the minimum number of edges in a shortest path from u to v. (Here, the shortest path is by weight, not the number of edges.) Suggest a simple change to the Bellman-Ford algorithm that allows it to terminate in m + 1 passes, even if m is not known in advance.

### `Answer`

We can simply implement this optimization of BELLMAN-FORD algorithm by
remebering if `v` was `relaxed or not`. If `v` is `relaxed` then we wait to see
if `v` was `udpated` (which means being relaxed again). If `v` was not
`updated`, then we would stop.

**P.S. More explanation:** 

 Because the greatest number of edges on any shortest
 path from the source is m, then the path-relaxation property tells us that
 after m iterations of BELLMAN-FORD, every vertex v has achieved its
 shortest-path weight in v.d. By the upper-bound property, after m iterations,
 no d values will ever change. Therefore, no d values will change in the (m+1)st
 iteration. Because we do not know m in advance, we cannot make the algorithm
 iterate exactly m times and then terminate. But if we just make the algorithm
 stop when nothing changes any more, it will stop after m + 1 iterations.

### Exercises 24.1-4
***
Modify the Bellman-Ford algorithm so that it sets d[v] to -∞ for all vertices v for which there is a negative-weight cycle on some path from the source to v.
