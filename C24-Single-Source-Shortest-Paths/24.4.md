### Exercises 24.4-2
***
Find a feasible solution or determine that no feasible solution exists for the following system of difference constraints:

x1 -x2 ≤4

x1 -x5 ≤5

x2 -x4 ≤-6

x3 -x2 ≤1

x4 -x5 ≤10

x5 -x3 ≤-4

x5 -x4 ≤-8

### `Answer`
没有解,因为x4 -> x2 -> x3 -> x5 -> x1 -> x4形成了一个负权回路.

### Exercises 24.4-3
***
Can any shortest-path weight from the new vertex v0 in a constraint graph be positive? Explain.

### `Answer`
不可能为正数,因为最大已经是0了.不可能大于0.

### Exercises 24.4-4
***
Express the single-pair shortest-path problem as a linear program.

### `Answer`
将G视为约束图，得到差分约束Ax<=b。设起点为i，终点为j，求解目标为 (xj - xi) 的最大值。

### Exercises 24.4-5
***
Show how to modify the Bellman-Ford algorithm slightly so that when it is used to solve a system of difference constraints with m inequalities on n unknowns, the running time is O(nm).

### `Answer`
V0这个顶点和他的n条权值为0的边其实是没有意义的,一开始初始化的时候可以对所有的点v,令d[v] = 0.

### Exercises 24.4-6
***
Suppose that in addition to a system of difference constraints, we want to handle **equality constraints** of the form xi = xj + bk. Show how the Bellman-Ford algorithm can be adapted to solve this variety of constraint system.

### `Answer`
xi >= xj + bk

xi <= xj + bk

### Exercises 24.4-7
***
Show how a system of difference constraints can be solved by a Bellman-Ford-like algorithm
that runs on a constraint graph without the extra vertex v0.

### `Answer`
同练习24.4-5

### Exercises 24.4-8 *
***
Let Ax ≤ b be a system of m difference constraints in n unknowns. Show that the Bellman- Ford algorithm, when run on the corresponding constraint graph, maximizes ￼**x1+x2+...+xn** subject to Ax≤b and xi ≤0 for all xi.

### `Answer`
先用Bellman-Ford算法找出一组解,然后找出(x1,x2,...xn)中最大的一个数假设为xi,然后加上d(d可能>0,= 0或者<0)变成0.其他数字也加上d.然后求和.

### Exercises 24.4-9 *
***
Show that the Bellman-Ford algorithm, when run on the constraint graph for a system Ax ≤ b of difference constraints, minimizes the quantity (max {xi} - min {xi}) subject to Ax ≤ b. Explain how this fact might come in handy if the algorithm is used to schedule construction jobs.

### `Answer`
UNSOLVED

### Exercises 24.4-10
***
Suppose that every row in the matrix A of a linear program Ax ≤ b corresponds to a difference constraint, a single-variable constraint of the form xi ≤ bk, or a single-variable constraint of the form -xi ≤ bk. Show how to adapt the Bellman-Ford algorithm to solve this variety of constraint system.

### `Answer`
新造一个节点u,令约束条件变成xi - xu ≤ bk.

并且初始化d(u) = 0.

### Exercises 24.4-11
***
Give an efficient algorithm to solve a system Ax ≤ b of difference constraints when all of the
elements of b are real-valued and all of the unknowns xi must be integers.

### `Answer`
把所有的b向下取整。因为 xi - xj ≤ b 同时 xi - xj 是整数，可得 xi - xj 一定小于等于b向下取整。 

### Exercises 24.4-12 *
***
Give an efficient algorithm to solve a system Ax ≤ b of difference constraints when all of the elements of b are real-valued and a specified subset of some, but not necessarily all, of the unknowns xi must be integers.

### `Answer`
UNSOLVED
