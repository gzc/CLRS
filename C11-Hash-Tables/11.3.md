### Exercises 11.3-1
***
Suppose we wish to search a linked list of length n, where each element contains a key k along with a hash value h(k). Each key is a long character string. How might we take advantage of the hash values when searching the list for an element with a given key?

### `Answer`
首先计算出给定关键字的hash值. 对列表中的每个元素,先验证hash值对不对,再进行字符串的比较.


### Exercises 11.3-2
***
Suppose that a string of r characters is hashed into m slots by treating it as a radix-128 number and then using the division method. The number m is easily represented as a 32-bit computer word, but the string of r characters, treated as a radix-128 number, takes many words. How can we apply the division method to compute the hash value of the character string without using more than a constant number of words of storage outside the string itself?

### `Answer`
可以取一个31位的素数，取模

### Exercises 11.3-3
***
Consider a version of the division method in which h(k) = k mod m, where m = 2p - 1 and k is a character string interpreted in radix 2p. Show that if string x can be derived from string y by permuting its characters, then x and y hash to the same value. Give an example of an application in which this property would be undesirable in a hash function.

### `Answer`
有一个很简单的数论知识.先举个例子

3 * 128^3 mod 127 = 3 * 128^2 * (128 mod 127) mod 127 = 3 * 128^2 mod 127 = 3 mod 127 = 3

无论怎么交换字符串的order,radix的影响都会消失. 因为2p^n mod 2p-1 === 1.

***
Consider a hash table of size m = 1000 and a corresponding hash function h(k) = ⌊m(k A mod1)⌋ for ￼ 
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? A = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}). Compute the locations to which the keys 61, 62, 63, 64, and 65 are mapped.

### `Answer`
 key | value
 :----:|:----:
 61 | 700
 62 | 318
 63 | 936
 64 | 554
 65 | 172

### Exercises 11.3-5
***
Define a family 
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\mathscr{H} )
 of hash functions from a finite set U to a finite set B to be **ϵ-universal** if for all pairs of distinct elements k and l in U,
 
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\Pr\\{h\(k\) = h\(l\)\\} \\le \\epsilon)

where the probability is over the choice of the hash function **h** drawn at random from the family ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\mathscr{H} ). Show that an ϵ-universal family of hash functions must have

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\epsilon \\ge \\frac{1}{|B|} - \\frac{1}{|U|})

### Exercises 11.3-6
***
Let U be the set of n-tuples of values drawn from Zp, and let B = Zp, where p is prime. Definethe hash function hb : U → B for b in Zp on an input n-tuple [a0, a1, ..., an-1] from U as

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?h_b\(\\langle a_0, a_1, \\ldots, a_{n-1} \\rangle\) =
   \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} a_j b^j})
   
and let H={hb:b∈Zp}. Argue that H is ((n−1)/p)-universal according to the definition of ϵ-universal in Exercise 11.3-5. (Hint: See Exercise 31.4-4.)
